1.  Introduction

   The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure is a system for secure self-
   certifying Identifiers which aims at minimum sufficiency and maximum
   security.  It defines mechanisms for proving the Root of Trust for
   self-certifying Identifiers and their associated Key State.  This
   spec defines a transform from Key State to DID Document, such that
   any valid Key Event Log can be processed into a DID Document.

   A close analogy is did:peer, except that where the data model of
   did:peer is a DID Document and JSON patches on said Document, the
   basic data model of did:keri is an append-only log of Key Events.
   KERI-based Identifiers are suitable for both any-wise and n-wise
   purposes.

2.  Concepts

2.1.  Events

   A Key Event is an atomic transaction over the Key State of an
   Identifier.  While all events have some semantic meaning within KERI,
   only a subset will change the keys in a Key State (rotation and
   delegated rotation).

2.2.  Key Event Log

   The Key Event Log is a type of hash-chained data structure from which
   the Key State of an Identifier can be derived.  It can always be used
   to recreate the state at any point ("event-sourcing").

2.3.  Key Event Receipt Log

   The Key Event Receipt Logs are built from receipts of events signed
   by the witnesses of those events (these are called commitments);
   these are also append-only but not hash-chained.

2.4.  Key State

   Key State represents the current values for the keys, witnesses and
   thresholds for a given identifier, signed by a provider.  The
   signature from the provider signifies that the provider has verified
   the KEL for the identifier and the result of that verification is the
   key state.  The key state is represented in a Key State Notification
   Message detailed fully in Event Serialization Key State Messages
   (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/
   kid0003.md#key-state-messages).  The following fields are defined for
   a Key State Notification Message:

   *  v: Version String

   *  i: Identifier Prefix

   *  s: Sequence Number

   *  t: Message Type

   *  d: Event Digest (Seal or Receipt)

   *  p: Prior Event Digest

   *  kt: Keys Signing Threshold

   *  k: List of Signing Keys (ordered key set)

   *  n: Next Key Set Commitment

   *  wt: Witnessing Threshold

   *  w: List of Witnesses (ordered witness set)

   *  wr: List of Witnesses to Remove (ordered witness set)

   *  wa: List of Witnesses to Add (ordered witness set)

   *  c: List of Configuration Traits/Modes

   *  a: List of Anchors (seals)

   *  da: Delegator Anchor Seal in Delegated Event (Location Seal)

   *  di: Delegator Identifier Prefix in Key State

   *  rd: Merkle Tree Root Digest

   *  e: Last received Event Map in Key State

   *  ee: Last Establishment Event Map in Key State

   *  vn: Version Number ("major.minor")

   Key state notification messages differ depending on whether the
   signer is using a delegated identifier.  The follow examples detail
   the fields needed for each permutation.

2.5.  Resolver Metadata

   did:keri defines keyState DID Document Metadata (see DID Document
   Metadata (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#output-
   documentmetadata) in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]]).

 *  keyState is the verified state of the KEL for the identifier
    represented by this DID Doc (See Key State).

2.6.  The DID Document

   The following field MAY appear in a did:keri DID document:
   verificationMethod

   Non-normative note: multiple namespaces using the same DID method
   could prove control or replay history for one controlling keypair
   that has been used across multiple ledgers.  KERL logs could be
   stored in a secondary root of trust (i.e., a ledger), and similar or
   identical resolver metadata could be returned by querying the same
   identifier there.

   The following field is not a core field in a did:keri DID document:
   Services.  The did:keri method is provided for interoperability for
   the purpose of using KERI to establish control authority of the
   current public keys associated with KERI identifier behind the
   keri:did DID.  It is anticipated that KERI tunnel methods (eg.
   did:indy:sov:keri) will provide these features to enable addition
   interop.

3.  The did:keri Format

   The format for the did:keri method conforms to the [[DID-CORE]]
   specification and is simple.  It consists of the did:keri: prefix,
   followed by the identifier prefix.

3.1.  Method Name

   The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: keri

   A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
   did:keri:. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
   lowercase.  The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is the method
   specific identifier (MSI) described below.

3.2.  Method Specific Identifier

   The method specific identifier for the did:keri method is the prefix
   for a content self-addressing self-certifying identifier.

   A self-addressing, self-certifying identifier is cryptographically
   bound to the inception keys used to create it.  The rationale and
   process for the derivation of an identifier is described in detail in
   the Derivation Codes (https://github.com/decentralized-
   identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0001.md#derivation-codes) section
   of [[KID0001]]

        did:keri:EXq5YqaL6L48pf0fu7IUhL0JRaU2\_RxFP0AL43wYn148

4.  Operations

   The following section outlines the DID operations for the did:keri
   method.

4.1.  Create

   Creation of a did:keri DID is accomplished by creating, signing and
   publishing an Inception event.  If witnesses are listed in the
   inception event, the receipts are also required for DID creation to
   be complete.

   Detailed steps for prefix derivation are in [[KID0001]] and witness
   configuration in [[KID0009]].  Inception events are covered in
   [[KID0003]].

4.2.  Read

   Steps to resolve a `did:keri:$PREFIX` DID:

   1.  Find the Key Event Log for the prefix `$PREFIX`. The method for
       discovering the Key Event Log is outside the scope of this
       specification.  Possible implementations include the use of a
       Distributed Hash Table (DHT), anchoring a KEL in a ledger or the
       use of a gossip protocol involving a witness network.

   2.  Process the KEL into a Key State, according to the state
       validation rules/semantics of KERI as defined in [[KID0008]]

   3.  Create a DID Document with the DID `did:keri:$PREF`

   4.  For each key K in the Key State, add a Verification Method to the
       DID Doc containing K and the appropriate type, with the ID of K
       being K's prefix form (alternatively, the ID could be an integer
       of K's index in the current signer list)

   5.  Add the Key State as DID Document Metadata as defined inResolver
       Metadata

   Establishment of control authority can be done independently of DID
   document contents, as long as the Key State is provided in the DID
   Document Metadata.  See Resolver Metadata.

4.3.  Update

   Updating a did:keri DID is accomplished by publishing establishment
   events to the KEL for performing operations such as key rotation and
   updating signature thresholds, witnesses and delegates.

   A detailed description of event types, their semantics and uses can
   be found in [[KID0003]].

4.4.  Deactivate

   Deactivation of a did:keri DID consists of rotation to 0 controlling
   keys, which terminates the ability to recover the identifier and
   indicates that the identifier has been abandoned.  Identifiers which
   are delegated to by an abandoned Identifier are also considered
   abandoned (delegating Ixn events can no longer be created).

   Detailed steps are specified in [[KID0003]].

5.  Privacy Considerations

   A breakdown of the privacy considerations from [[RFC6973]] section 5
   is provided below.

5.1.  Surveillance

   A robust witness network along with consistent witness rotation
   provides protection from monitoring and association of an
   individual's activity inside a KERI network.

5.2.  Stored Data Compromise

   For resolvers that simply discover the Key State endorsed by another
   party in a discovery network, caching policies of that network would
   guide stored data security considerations.  In the event that a
   resolver is also the endorsing party, meaning they have their own
   KERI identifier and are verifying the KEL and signing the Key State
   themselves, leveraging the facilities provided by the KERI protocol
   (key rotation, witness maintenance, multi-sig) should be used to
   protect the identities used to sign the Key State.

   See [[KID0005]] for information on KERI key rotation, [[KID0009]] for
   a discussion on witnesses and [[KID0004]] for KERI's support of
   multi-sig.

5.3.  Unsolicited Traffic

   DID Documents are not required to provide endpoints and thus not
   subject to unsolicited traffic.

5.4.  Misattribution

   This DID Method relies on KERI's duplicity detection to determine
   when the non-repudiable controller of a DID has been inconsistent and
   can no longer be trusted.  This establishment of non-repudiation
   enables consistent attribution.

   See [[KID0010]] for a detailed description of KERI'S Agreement
   Algorithm for Control Establishment (KAACE).

5.5.  Correlation

   The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore
   offers no direct means of correlation.  In addition, KERI provides
   two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct
   mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that can be
   used to establish private relationships.

   See [[KID0001]] for a description of KID prefix generation and
   [[KID0009]] for a comparison between Direct and Indirect modes.

5.6.  Identification

   The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore
   offers no direct means of identification.  In addition, KERI provides
   two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct
   mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that can be
   used to establish private relationships.

   See [[KID0001]] for a description of KID prefix generation and
   [[KID0009]] for a comparison between Direct and Indirect modes.

5.7.  Secondary Use

   The Key State made available in the metadata of this DID method is
   generally available and can be used by any party to retrieve and
   verify the state of the KERL for the given identifier.

5.8.  Disclosure

   No data beyond the Key State for the identifier is provided by this
   DID method.

5.9.  Exclusion

   This DID method provides no opportunity for correlation (See
   Section 5.5), identification (See Section 5.6) or disclosure (See
   Section 5.8) and therefore there is no opportunity to exclude the
   controller from knowing about data that others have about them.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Key State Verification

   Users of a did:keri did method resolver MUST verify the key state
   returned in the document metadata of the resolution result.  The
   signature of the resolver can be used to determine if the resolver is
   dysfunctional and should no longer be trusted.  However it should not
   be used to verify the key state.

   The only definitive method for verifying the key state is to pass the
   key state to a KERI library and perform the verification of that key
   state.

   A breakdown of the security considerations from [[RFC3552]] is
   provided below.

6.2.  Confidentiality Violations, Password Sniffing

   All private keys used to establish control over the KERI identifier
   of a KERI DID method DID should be held secret.  KERI's use of
   delegation ensures that private keys for each identifier never need
   to be transferred.  DID controllers can delegate levels of authority
   of other identities to enable remote agents.

   See [[KID0007]] for a discussion of delegation.

   In addition, pre-rotation mechanism provides key rotation
   capabilities while eliminating exposure of the next public key until
   it is rotated into the current signing key.  Enforcing key rotation
   for every event of a given identifier provides further protection
   against key exposure.

   See [[KID0005]] for a description of pre-rotation and the protections
   it provides

6.3.  Replay Attacks

   did:keri relies on the KERI protocol which is not susceptible to
   replay attacks.  The hash linking, signatures and sequence numbers of
   events ensures that replayed messages do not effect the protocol.

   See [[KID0003]] for a description of KERI events.

6.4.  Message Insertion, Deletion, Modification

   did:keri relies on the KERI protocol which is not susceptible to
   message deletion or modification attacks.  The hash linking,
   signatures and sequence numbers of events ensures that messages can
   not be modified or deleted without immediate detection.  In addition,
   KERI's duplicity detection mechanisms allow easy detection of
   inserted messages allowing validators to determine the consistency of
   a DID controller.

   See [[KID0003]] for a description of KERI events and [[KID0010]] for
   the KAACE algorithm.

6.5.  Man-In-The-Middle Attacks

   The protections mentioned in Replay Attacksand Message Attacksrender
   Man-In-The-Middle attacks ineffective against the KERI protocol and
   this DID Method.

7.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
